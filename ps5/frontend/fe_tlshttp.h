// Genesis Plus GX PS5: the helper's own HTTPS client, for the covers it downloads in the background.
//
// On the console libSceSsl only works inside the app's sandbox: 1.5's helper (a payload) got 8095f00c from
// sceHttp2SendRequest for every GET, in 20 ms, as the app does after its jailbreak (fe_prefetch.h). So the helper
// does its own: plain sockets, the address from getaddrinfo (then libSceNet's resolver, then GitHub's published
// addresses for raw.githubusercontent.com), TLS 1.2/1.3 from Mbed TLS (third_party/mbedtls, Apache-2.0), the
// server's certificate checked against Mozilla's CA list (data/cacert.pem, from certifi, MPL-2.0) and its name.
// HTTP/1.1, with the connection kept between requests, redirects followed, chunked answers read.
