// Genesis Plus GX PS5: the dashboard app asks to be let out of its sandbox (ProsperoJailbreak.cpp), and the payload
// that does it (ProsperoHelper.cpp).
//
// The app (eboot.bin, a native title like PS5SX2's) starts inside the console's sandbox: no /data, no USB
// drives. PS5SX2 asks a jailbreak daemon for full rights when it starts (its main-boot.cpp, orbis_try_jailbreak:
// the PS5SX2 Helper or etaHEN, 127.0.0.1:9028/9069, a 0xDEADBEEF command 5 with the app's pid). Genesis Plus GX PS5 does the
// same, first with its own helper -- GenesisPlusGXPS5.elf stays running as one after it installs the app -- then with
// those two. When nobody answers, the app sends the helper built into it (GenesisPlusGXPS5-helper.elf) to the
// console's ELF loader (127.0.0.1:9021) and asks again.
//
// The helper only lets out the Genesis Plus GX PS5 title (PPSA99011): it gives the process root's folder view
// (/data, /mnt/usbN) and uid 0. It never touches another title.
